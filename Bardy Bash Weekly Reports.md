# Week 1: 09-20-23
## Overall Progress:
The week of set up. With the recent controversy surrounding Unity we have decided to switch to Godot. The focus this week was to get everyone set up on the GitHub Repo. Tyler was a huge help in setting up everyone’s local machines to be able to interact with the repo. Charles made a song sketch and Cat started work on the UI/UX design. Tyler, Kevin, and Sumira have been researching Godot and how to create a rhythm game making this game engine. Overall, I am very proud of this team for being able to switch from one platform to another so seamlessly, of course not having much done in Unity did help with the transition.

# Week 2: 09-27-23
## Overall Progress: 
Getting Started. With last week’s major change, the main goal of the past week has been providing a good foundation for the project. Project Management worked on creating a SCRUM-like format for everyone to follow and encouraged setting up smaller meetings for each team including pair-programming to minimize potential miscommunications in the future. The Gameplay team, in addition to starting on the first scene, has been working on better understanding Godot and evaluating strategies to better utilize the tools provided for this platform. The UI/UX team has re-evaluated the current planned layout for the game, and have drafted a more cohesive layout.

# Week 2: 10-04-23
## Overall Progress: 
**Overcoming hurdles.** The major issue of this project has been figuring out how to get Godot to read MIDI files so that notes could be spawned from them. The gameplay team was hard at work and discovered a C# package called “DryWetMidi” and have made great progress in producing basic outputs that can later be adjusted to spawn notes. Additionally, a rough scene for the first level has been made to work on the more visual aspect of note creation and falling. The UI Team has created a skeleton Main Menu with basic play & quit functionality. The Music Team has also produced additional sketches for the first level.

# Week 4: 10-8-23
## Overall Progress:
**Slow, but Steady.**  The Focus of this week has been setting up minimum functionality for the first stage or level of the game. Once we are able to reach this milestone, we will be able to have a minimally functioning level. The Gameplay Team has been focused on creating Spawners for Music Notes, as well as objects for these notes to collide with. It is worth noting that the current spawners are not actually spawning notes for the music, but are instead being used to prepare the basic functions of gameplay for actual note production. Meanwhile, the UI team has begun work on displaying an options menu.
